# Brax API apiary documentation

http://docs.brax.apiary.io/

## How does it work

The `Makefile` will do most of the work if the right dependencies are installed...

- Hercule
  - https://github.com/jamesramsay/hercule
- Apiary CLI
  - https://help.apiary.io/tools/apiary-cli/

`hercule.md` can be considered the root of this project and can be used as a starting point of reference.

`apiary.apib` should not be modified directly since it will be overwritten by the make script.

Markdown tables will be generated by `data_structures.php` based on the contents of `blueprint/data_structures.apib`.

Files are included by Hercule within blueprints using the directive `:[](filename.apib)`.

## How to contribue

- Clone this repository
- Stick to editing the files in the blueprint folder
- If a file is added, make sure to update hercule.md
- Run `make` to compile apiary.apib
- Run `make preview` to invoke ApiaryIO CLI tool to preview in HTML
